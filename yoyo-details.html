            <p>Yoyo loves to snuggle on your lap after a long day. He'll curl in a ball and nap.</p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I was adopted from a shelter and was so happy to find a home here at the cafe.</p>
            <p>My brother Vanny is also here, but we don't get along.</p>
            <p>I am exceptionally smart. If I want to leave the cafe and go to my home upstairs,
                I walk past the video doorbell until it makes a funny noise.
                Then I wait until one of my humans opens the door for me. I've trained them well.</p>
            <p>If I'm <em>lonely</em>, I meow loudly.
                When <span>I'm hungry</span>, I stand by my bowl.</p>
